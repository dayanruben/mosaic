	 * [mode 2048 in-band resize events](https://gist.github.com/rockorager/e695fb2924d36b2bcf1fff4a3704bd83)

	 * records from the console. Only the row and column values of the [ResizeEvent] will be present.

	 * On Linux and macOS this installs a `SIGWINCH` signal handler which then queries `TIOCGWINSZ`
	 * using `ioctl`.
	 *
	 * Note: You can also respond to resize events which lack necessary data by sending `XTWINOPS`
	 * to query row/col counts and/or window or cell size in pixels. More details
